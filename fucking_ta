Hi Konor,

I would like to apologize for lateness and didn't response on time. My partner, Zepeng, and me, worked together for Lab 4. Zepeng worked on the timer and the switch, while I worked on the ADC. When Zepeng finished his code, he sent me his code and put everything together and I wrote the main function. I probably fogot to mention Zepeng in comments, however we did worked together. Again, I apologize for my carelessness, and we will do better next time.

In terms of the programming language, thank you for pointting that out and I will soon contact Prof. Hetherington to sort this out. I apologize for any inconvenience.

Best Regards
Shengrui Zhang
